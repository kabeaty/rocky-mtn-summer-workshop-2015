	<h2>Program</h2>
	
	<h3>Overview</h3>
	
	<p>The Rocky Mountain Summer Workshop in Uncertainty Quantification (RMSWUQ) is an intensive educational and training workshop with several short- and long-term goals.
    <ul>
    <li>Provide an intensive collaborative research opportunity for graduate students and postdoctoral research scientists interested in the many areas of uncertainty quantification ranging from verification & validation of computational models, error analysis/estimation, and statistical/probabilistic methods for quantifying uncertainties in forward and inverse problems.
    <br><br>
    
    <li> Provide hands-on training and guidance in the use of state-of-the-art computational tools for UQ by developers and users.
    <br><br>
   
    <li>Nurture long-lasting research collaborations between participating students, postdocs, and faculty.
    <br><br>
    
    <li> Help students build a professional network of peers within their broad research area.
      </ul>
      <br><br>
      
      Each day of the workshop has a specific theme, and the morning sessions are coordinated across each day. In the afternoon of each day, we have a breakout session focusing on the development and/or use of specific computational tools related to the theme of the day. 
<br><br>

The first day focuses on aspects of verification & validation (V&V) with complementary topics on error analysis/estimation and model determination. The morning presentations will focus on specific physical problems studied by large research groups and the choice of physical equations and numerical methods used to study these problems. The first day will also have an afternoon session of presentations centered on the analysis and estimation of errors and modeling issues that are broadly applicable to most computational models. The afternoon breakout session will provide a hands-on tutorial for adjoint based a posteriori error analysis for physics based models with examples written using the state-of-the-art open-source software FEniCS (Finite Element Computational Software) as well as simple linear examples for less experienced programmers written in Python and Matlab.
<br><br>

The second day focuses on the methodologies used for forward and inverse propagation of uncertainties through computational models. The morning presentations will use the previous day models for context and to make the methodologies more concrete while focusing primarily on the description of the UQ framework used and describing relevant implementation details. The afternoon breakout session will provide a hands-on tutorial for the state-of-the-art open-source software QUESO (Quantification of Uncertainty for Estimation, Simulation, and Optimization Toolkit).
<br><br>

The third day focuses on the application of the UQ methodologies to specific applications. The morning presentations will discuss results where methods from day two are applied to the models of day one. The afternoon breakout session will provide a hands-on tutorial for the state-of-the-art open-source software BET developed by the organizers. In the early evening, we will hold a panel discussion to coordinate future activities and provide concluding remarks on the workshop.
